# ipelet_toolbox
Collection of Ipelets for small tasks

To install move the .lua file(s) into the ipelets directory of your installation before starting ipe, 
see Section 8.6, "Customizing Ipe", of the ipe manual. Then the ipelets can be accessed under the Ipelets menu.
You can see the ipelets path in Show configuration in ipe's Help menu. 

## Line through 2 points
This ipelet needs a selection of two marks or a single segment. It adds a line (bounded by the drawing canvas) through the 2 marks/the 2 endpoints of the segment.
